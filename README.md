# Pricing Analytics 

Let's learn how to price stuff in the real world and see where we land with this. We will try to work backwards, from a best case scenario. The best case scenario for a pricing/discounting engine is to predict what price should be given to users in order to maximise the revenue on an overall level. The real world applications, I see today are in the domains of 

 1. airline pricing
 2. hotel pricing
 3. loan pricing 
 4. discounting 
 5. revenue management 

Hope in the future you have more guidance than I do today :)
